Test Scenario 1: Empty Image
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when an empty image is inputted. 
- Expected Result: The function should return an empty array or appropriate error message.

Test Scenario 2: Image with Single Color
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when an image of a single color is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should return an array of a single value.

Test Scenario 3: Image with Multiple Colors
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when an image with multiple colors is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should return an array with multiple values.

Test Scenario 4: Image with Different Aspect Ratios
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when an image with different aspect ratios is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should adjust the image size accordingly and return an array with the correct dimensions.

Test Scenario 5: Image with High Resolution
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when a high resolution image is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should resize the image properly and return an array with the correct dimensions.

Test Scenario 6: Image with Low Resolution
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when a low resolution image is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should still be able to process the image and return an array with the correct dimensions.

Test Scenario 7: Image with Different Threshold Values
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when an image with different threshold values is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should return an array with the correct values according to the threshold applied.

Test Scenario 8: Image with Different Shapes
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when an image of different shapes is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should return an array with the correct dimensions.

Test Scenario 9: Image with Different Sizes
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when an image of different sizes is inputted.
- Expected Result: The function should resize the image properly and return an array with the correct dimensions.

Test Scenario 10: Non-Image Input
- Description: Test the behavior of the function when a non-image input is provided.
- Expected Result: The function should return an appropriate error message.
