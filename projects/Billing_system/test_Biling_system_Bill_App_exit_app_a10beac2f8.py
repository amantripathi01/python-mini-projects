Test generated by RoostGPT for test aman-4Dec using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

Test Scenario 1: User Confirmation
- Description: The function should create a message box asking the user if they really want to exit the application. The function should wait for the user's response before proceeding.
- Expected Result: A message box appears with the question "Do you really want to exit?" and two options: 'yes' and 'no'.

Test Scenario 2: Positive User Response
- Description: If the user clicks 'yes' in the confirmation message box, the application should be closed.
- Expected Result: The application closes when the user clicks 'yes'.

Test Scenario 3: Negative User Response
- Description: If the user clicks 'no' in the confirmation message box, the application should remain open.
- Expected Result: The application remains open when the user clicks 'no'.

Test Scenario 4: Multiple Instances
- Description: If multiple instances of the application are open, only the instance from which the exit function was called should be closed.
- Expected Result: Only the instance of the application from which the exit function was called is closed.

Test Scenario 5: No User Response
- Description: If the user does not respond to the message box and it times out or is otherwise dismissed, the application should remain open.
- Expected Result: The application remains open if the user does not respond to the exit confirmation message box.

Test Scenario 6: Multiple Confirmation Messages
- Description: If the user clicks to exit multiple times before responding to the first exit confirmation message, only one confirmation message should be displayed.
- Expected Result: Only one exit confirmation message is displayed, regardless of how many times the user clicks to exit before responding.

Test Scenario 7: Exit During Task
- Description: If the user clicks to exit while a task is being processed, the application should ask for confirmation before closing and potentially losing unsaved work.
- Expected Result: The application asks for confirmation before closing, even if a task is currently being processed.
