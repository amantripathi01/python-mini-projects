Test generated by RoostGPT for test aman-4Dec using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Scenario: Check if the thread is created successfully.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called,
   - When the function runs,
   - Then the thread "t1" should be created successfully.

2. Scenario: Check if the thread "t1" is started successfully.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called,
   - When the function runs,
   - Then the thread "t1" should be started successfully.

3. Scenario: Check if the target function "alarm" is executed when the thread starts.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called,
   - When the function runs,
   - Then the "alarm" function should be executed.

4. Scenario: Check if the function is able to handle multiple threads if called multiple times.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called multiple times,
   - When the function runs,
   - Then multiple threads should be created and started successfully.

5. Scenario: Check if the function is able to handle exceptions if the target function "alarm" throws any error.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called,
   - When the "alarm" function throws an exception,
   - Then the "Threading" function should be able to handle the exception gracefully.

6. Scenario: Check if the function is able to stop the thread execution if the "alarm" function is completed.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called,
   - When the "alarm" function completes its execution,
   - Then the thread "t1" should stop its execution.

7. Scenario: Check if the function is able to handle the case where the "alarm" function takes longer to complete.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called,
   - When the "alarm" function takes longer to complete,
   - Then the thread "t1" should continue its execution without blocking the main thread.

8. Scenario: Check if the function is able to handle the case where the "alarm" function is not defined.
   - Given that the "Threading" function is called,
   - When the "alarm" function is not defined,
   - Then the "Threading" function should throw an appropriate error.
